# Predictive Analytics on the academic record of NUCES

## Abstract
Predictive Analytics is the process of using past data to make future predictions . The past data is used to capture important trends with the help of a mathematical model and the 
model is then used to make predictions on current data . Our aim is to perform predictive analytics on the academic record of NUCES . The basis of any model is the features using 
which the model is built. In FYP-I we targeted those features which we will be using , in the second phase of our project , to build the predictive model. We used the past 
academic record of NUCES to make insights and find out correlations between different attributes. Finally a dashboard was built to display the insights and the analytics.

## Programming language
R language was used to perform all the work related to data analytics.
Python was used for model building and predictive modeling.

## Software Tools
For the data cleaning , transformation and EDA , R studio was used . 
GUI was designed using Tkinter.

## Dataset Description
● The data used for our project was provided by FAST NUCES for all the FIVE campuses of NUCES i-e Faisalabad , Islamabad , Karachi , Lahore and Peshawar.

● The data contained academic records of undergraduate level (Bachelors) students for the past 19 years from Fall 2001 to Summer 2019 .

● The dataset provided was given in four separate excel sheets Student Data , Semester Data , Course Data 1 , Course Data 2 .

Student Data : Contained details about student gender , batch , campus , program code , CGPA , first semester , last semester , city , SSC Board , SSC obtained etc.

Semester Data: Contained academic details of students for each semester throughout the graduation cycle. The attributes included semester , sgpa , cgpa , core course count , 
elective course count . Information about each semester of a particular student was given row wise.

Course Data 1 & Course Data 2: Both these datasets had the same columns: semester , student id , code , title , credit hours , course type , relation id , grade , grade point . 
The data of each student was given in several rows to cover all his/her courses.
