# Predictive Analytics on the academic record of NUCES

## Abstract
Predictive Analytics is the process of using past data to make future predictions . The past data is used to capture important trends with the help of a mathematical model and the 
model is then used to make predictions on current data . Our aim is to perform predictive analytics on the academic record of NUCES . The basis of any model is the features using 
which the model is built. In FYP-I we targeted those features which we will be using , in the second phase of our project , to build the predictive model. We used the past 
academic record of NUCES to make insights and find out correlations between different attributes. Finally a dashboard was built to display the insights and the analytics.

## Programming language
R language was used to perform all the work related to data analytics.
Python was used for model building and predictive modeling.

## Software Tools
For the data cleaning , transformation and EDA , R studio was used . 
GUI was designed using Tkinter.

## Dashboard
